### Project Overview

Creating a sustainable PowerPoint presentation involves considering environmental impact, minimizing resource usage, and promoting eco-friendly practices.
Presentations are a ubiquitous part of professional communication in nearly every field, from business and academia to healthcare and nonprofits, we need to make presentations and making them in another way will contribute to a more sustainable digital environment. 


### Description

Building a tailored carbon reduction plan involves using and selecting a green template for presentations. It is better to create a cohesive message, by minimizing text and sharing a compressed images and visuals, reducing the file size. A success criteria would be to obtain a file size less than  50 MB file size to ensure that it can be easily shared and opened on most devices. A 50 MB presentation could contribute around 1,000 grams or 1 kilogram of CO2 (50 MB * 20 grams/MB). 



### Next Steps

It is important to identify actions and define success measurements for implementing sustainable design of  presentations, from 1 week till 1 month.
Establish a commitment from leadership to prioritize sustainability as a core value.
Educate employees about the importance of sustainability and how their individual actions can contribute.
Recognize and reward employees for their contributions to sustainability.

### Limitations

It could be created a gap between where the organization is and where it needs to be, by selecting wrong objectives, challenges on decinding th final look of the presentation to make active engagement of the audience. Dependence on technology could create some issues can also be a vulnerability in some situations.
